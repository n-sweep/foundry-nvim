> WARNING: this plugin is under active development and is not intended for use by anyone

- Inspired by [`molten-nvim`](https://github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim) and its predecessors
- Intended to interact with jupyter notebooks opened with [jupytext.nvim](https://github.com/GCBallesteros/jupytext.nvim) in neovim
    - Rather than defining cells through selection, cell bounds are detected based on delimiters (`# %%`) generated by `jupytext`
